# Chess game

A very simple two-player chess game built using the libGDX game development
framework. Credits to ChatGPT for helping me with learning Java. *[Pixel Chess Pieces by Lucas312](https://opengameart.org/content/pixel-chess-pieces)*.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply download the executable jar file *(https://github.com/lucksei/Chess-game/releases/tag/v1.0)* and run it on your computer. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

If you prefer to build the game from source, you can do so using the Gradle build tool. Simply run the following command from the project root directory:

```
./gradlew desktop:dist
```

This will create an executable jar file in the `desktop/build/libs` directory.
